    <p>Okay, today am gonna tell you something, so listen carefully. I know it's your birthday, but I am not here to say happy birthday or to wish you luck. Am here to tell you what no one has the courage to tell you.</p>
    <p>I know you have the power to change every problem into a solution, but you're not working on it. If you have to leave everything, including your friends, leave them. I don't care what they will think or say. I care about you, so think carefully.</p>
    <p>If you're ready for the next step, there is a challenge for you. Just tap the picture if you're ready for the challenge.</p>

    <p>I know my words are kinda scary, but know this too: I can just say happy birthday, bro, love you so much, bla bla bla... but nothing will happen or change. So, let's begin ü´°</p>
    <p>#No procrastination!</p>
    <p>#No excuse!</p>
    <p>Allah will show you the way! üëç Good luck</p>
